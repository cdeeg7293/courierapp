# This model initially had no columns defined.  If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#
test_user: {}
# column: value
admin:
  email: 'a@b.c'
  encrypted_password: <%= User.new.send(:password_digest, 'pwd') %>
#
#two: {}
#  column: value
